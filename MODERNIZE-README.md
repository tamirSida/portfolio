# Modern Portfolio Redesign

This directory contains a complete redesign of your portfolio website with a modern, dark-mode focused aesthetic and consistent styling across all pages.

## Key improvements

1. **Modern dark theme** - Professional, sleek dark theme with accent colors that highlight your work
2. **Consistent styling** - Unified design language across all pages
3. **Improved responsiveness** - Better mobile experience with optimized layouts
4. **Animation effects** - Subtle fade-in animations and interactive elements
5. **Improved typography** - Better readability and hierarchical structure
6. **Optimized project showcasing** - Enhanced project cards and detail pages

## Implementation Guide

To implement this redesign, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Copy new CSS and JS files

1. Copy `styles/modern.css` to your styles directory
2. Copy `js/modern.js` to your js directory

### Step 2: Implement the new index page

1. Rename `index-modern.html` to `index.html` (or test it first by keeping both)
2. Ensure all paths to images and other resources are correct

### Step 3: Update project pages

Use the following files as templates for your project pages:
- `project-template-modern.html` - Base template for all project pages
- `range-management-modern.html` - Example implementation

For each project page:
1. Create a new file following the naming pattern: `[project-name]-modern.html`
2. Use the template to structure your content
3. Fill in all placeholders (marked with `[PLACEHOLDER]`) with your content
4. Once tested, rename to remove the `-modern` suffix

### Step 4: Testing

Before finalizing the implementation:
1. Test all pages on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
2. Check all links to ensure they navigate correctly
3. Verify all images load properly
4. Test the contact form functionality
